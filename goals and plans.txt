Rough timeline for getting a local cyber event running:

-get everyone using GitHub and develop rules for use
--how to update
--what to include
--when to update

Virtualized server event 
-Develop our configuration - October drill
--network nodes, services, workstations, overall connectivity
--operating systems that will be want to target
--user interface(how to engage the network)
--develop triggers, flags and points

-define a date for the event
-assign points of contact
-need to pull other flights into the mix (for buy in and managing of the work)
-fit capabilities with tasks

Longer term goals
-develop relationship with other ca guard units to create competition hubs
--should be easier if we use the virtualized servers
- more ideas
